                    Extra Credit:
                    1. In the tooltip of my Q2 Pie chart, I have a dynamic stats calculation module that computes and
                    presents the percentage of one genre's sale compared to all sales in a region.

                </p>
                <p>
                    1. The first question is answered by a bar plot that shows top 10 best game sellers between 1980
                    - 2020.</br>
                    My pie chart shows a clear genre sales breakdown for four regions. Users can hover over the
                    graph and see the sales and real-time calculated percentage data by a tooltip.
                    </br>
                    For question 3, I used another vertical barplot to present the top 5 best publishers for any
                    genre from 1980 - 2020.
                </p></br>
                <p> 2. (1). Data visualizations created by D3.JS is portable. Since they are running on a browser,
                    anyone
                    can access the dashboard through PC, laptop, phone or pad.</br>
                    (2). D3 also supports extensive charts like pie, bar, map, flow etc..</br>
                    (3). D3 offers high data flexibility to different formats of data storage, like .csv and .json
                    files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.(1). D3 has a variety of versions(from v3-v6) and the compatibility is a big concern.</br>
                    (2). D3 is a JavaScript library while normally data scientists use R or Python since they have
                    more libraries for statistical analysis and support faster calculation of big datasets.</br>
                    (3). D3 has a steep initial learning curve so it's unfriendly for new learners especially for
                    those who lack front-end programming experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. I think people with normal vision might find my dashboard accessible while it's more difficult
                    for people with blindness or colorblindness to access. Inspired by dos and don'ts section of "A
                    Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization", in the design stage of my first chart, I
                    delibrately used dropdown inputs instead of a fancy slider to receive year selection from users
                    since a dropdown input can be used by screen readers. Also, for my pie chart, I added white strokes
                    to separate between different portions to provide a more clear view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. I learned from "Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization" that one approach for
                    presenting data as nonverbal sounds to blind people is called Sonification. However, I didn't add
                    that feature in my dashboard since I am new in this area and I only have limited time to finish this
                    assignment.
